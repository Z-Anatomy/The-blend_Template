# Z-Anatomy

This repository contains all Blender scripts for the Z-Anatomy Blender plugin.

View the differences between the portable script and template script with [diffchecker](https://www.diffchecker.com/LYQ2BQZq/).

The template script has more translations than the portable script.

## Where did I take the two scripts?

For the portable version, you can just go to the text editor and search for the file `z-anatomy.py`.

For the template version, `__init__.py` was taken from the downloaded template file `Z-Anatomy_Template` > `Z-Anatomy` > `__init__.py`.
