The Template Script has more translations than portable script

## Where Did i take the two scripts?

For the Portable version, you can just go to the text editor and search for the `z-anatomy.py`

For the Template version, `__init__.py` was taken from the downloaded template file `Z-Anatomy_Template` > `Z-Anatomy` > `__init__.py`
